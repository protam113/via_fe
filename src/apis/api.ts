/**
 * ==========================
 * üìå @API Services URL
 * ==========================
 *
 * @fileoverview Defines and exports the base URL used for all API service requests.
 * This setup allows flexible configuration depending on the environment
 * (e.g., development, staging, production) by using environment variables.
 *
 * @const {string} url - The root domain or server address for the backend API.
 *   - Defined in `.env` as NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL_DEV
 *   - Example: "https://api.example.com/"
 *
 * @const {string} version - The current version of the API being used.
 *   - Defined in `.env` as NEXT_PUBLIC_VERSION
 *   - Example: "v1"
 *
 * @const {string} baseURL - The complete base URL combining `url` and `version`.
 *   - Example result: "https://api.example.com/v1"
 *   - Used in Axios or Fetch setups to prefix all API calls consistently.
 *
 * ‚úÖ This keeps your API layer maintainable and adaptable across environments.

 * ==========================
 * üîó @API Endpoints
 * ==========================
 *
 * @fileoverview This file contains all endpoint paths used in API requests.
 * Defining all routes here helps keep your app consistent, maintainable, and scalable.
 *
 * üëâ Each key represents a specific backend feature or resource (e.g., Auth, User, Product).
 * üëâ Values are string paths that attach to your baseURL to form the full API route.
 *
 * üîÅ Easy to update: change routes in one place, affects all usage.
 * üîí Secure and dynamic via environment variables.
